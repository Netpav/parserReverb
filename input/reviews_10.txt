2	Very long corridor to the room, only one lift per level, therefore quite a far walking distance to room.
2	The near street is loud but the windows have good noise insulation. Cleanliness in singular spots could be a bit improved.
1	We liked the location of the hotel, overlooking the lake. We also liked the breakfast at Le Pirate restaurant downstairs, which was included in our rate.
2	I know we were in high season, but the price seemed a little high. Would have preferred a sea view but none available due to late booking - need to book earlier next time.                                                             On a practical point the temperature of bath and shower were safe, but we couldn't cool them down, consequently bathroom got very hot, not a very effective extractor fan
1	Very nice staff at check in and check out.
1	Cleaness, Location, Price, Space, had enough hot water and heater was working well. I liked this Lodge a lot.
2	i have prepared myself for the worst scenario so there's nothing i don't like about the hotel. it would be best to travel light as the metro station is about 10-15 mins of walk.
2	The bathroom had only a shower curtain and was water all around when we showered...
2	Unfortunately, I had lots of bed bug bites as a result of my stay at the hotel.
2	The room we stayed in, number 34, has an extremely loud air-conditioning system installed in the balcony. We had a terrible time trying to sleep, since, ironically, the air conditioning doesn't work! With closed windows the room gets hot and stuffy, with open windows the noise keeps you awake. Though everything else is quite acceptable in the hotel, this is no minor detail and it made our stay unbearable.
